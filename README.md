# Land-Mine
This is a little Minesweeper project I coded coded with C# <br/>
It only has the beginner 8X8 mode, and it does not same high scores, but I made this for learning experince.
## Instructions
You play it just like Minesweeper. Click on different tiles to reveal what is on the other side, you may have a mine, you may have a number, or you could have an empty square, which reveals the surrounding number tiles. When a mine is revealed, it's game over and you are shown where all the mines were. If you are certain a mine is under a tile, you may right click it to place an X on it, which does not allow you to uncover the tile, so you don't accidentally click it. If you feel that you placed an X on the wrong tile, don't let the limited amount of X's you can place discourage you. Right click the tile with an X to remove the X so you can place it elsewhere. Number tiles indicate how many mines are in the 8 surrounding tiles. The game is won when you uncover all the tiles that do not have mines.</br>
During play, your time and the current amount of X's to place (referred as flags in the GUI to familiarize Minesweeper vets) is tracked in the left side of the window. There is also a button to restart the game if you wish to do so.</br>
Enjoy my C# tinkering!
